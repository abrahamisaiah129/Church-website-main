          <p class="church-text">
            The young ministry had its inaugural Sunday morning service on the 1st of February, 1987 in his living room, then in the Ikeja area of Lagos state. As membership of the young but peculiar church grew into the hundreds and thousands, the surrounding grounds of his house became sitting area for the overspill from the living room. The ministry of the church and the person of Reverend Chris Okotie as a minister of the gospel became nationally recognized when the Lord Jesus Christ inspired the inauguration of the GRACE PROGRAMME and the television ministry, APOKALUPSIS.

    <p class="church-text mt-4">The charity driven GRACE programme was instituted in 1990 and has become a major benevolence channel of the ministry on an annual basis. The objective of the programme as directed by the Lord Jesus is to extend the arm of care and sharing to the less privileged in the society through recognized non governmental organizations who deal directly with such people. In 1996 the KARIS AWARD, yet another inspiration by the Lord Jesus, which is aimed at appreciating Nigerians who have positively impacted the nation but have not been recognized by the government, was instituted and subsumed into the GRACE programme.
